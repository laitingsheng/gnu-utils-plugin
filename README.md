# System Utils Plugin for Oh-My-Zsh & Oh-My-Bash

The plugin overrides most of the common aliases defined by Oh-My-Zsh and Oh-My-Bash such as `ls` itself and `ll`. It also enables colour printing on both GNU/Linux and macOS. This includes support of GNU toolsets installed by HomeBrew which are prefixed by `g` on macOS.
